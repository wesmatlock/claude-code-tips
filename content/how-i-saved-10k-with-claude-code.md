# How I saved $10,000 using Claude Code

When I started looking for a condo to purchase a few months ago, I knew I needed to find a realtor. It was a relatively new area for me, and I didn't know any good realtor there.

So I started my research like everyone else: with Google searches. I found a few promising ones and emailed them. However, none of them turned out to be good enough...

So I decided to use Claude Code for additional research. I asked it to find me the best realtors in the area I was looking at, excluding the ones I already contacted. I asked it for only the ones where it could find their email addresses. I asked it to give those email addresses to me directly into my clipboard, comma separated.

I didn't even type anything during this whole process - 100% voice input.

Then, I BCC'ed all of them and told them I'm looking to buy a property. Out of the 15 total "candidates" I had, I filtered based on their initial email responses, and spoke to a few of them. Based on that, I selected one I liked working with.

Now fast forward to a few months later, we found a property we liked! When I told this realtor I liked this property, his response was, "Shall we make an offer that's 10% less than the listing price?"

Internally, I was like, "Thank God yes!" I didn't even have to ask him to start with a low offer - he just knew what to do.

Then he kept making the best possible offer he could, and he negotiated as hard as possible. As a result, he saved us $10K in the end. Based on how aggressive he negotiated with the seller's realtor, I don't think any other realtor would've saved us this much.

So it's safe to say, Claude Code saved us $10K. It was off of a $100 subscription - so it gave me an ROI of 100x that month.
