## Requesting Permissions (allowedPrompts)
Request Bash permissions with semantic descriptions, not literal commands.

**Example:**
\`\`\`json
{ "allowedPrompts": [{ "tool": "Bash", "prompt": "run tests" }] }
\`\`\`

**Guidelines:**
- "run tests" matches: npm test, pytest, go test, etc.
- Scope narrowly: "read-only database queries" not "database queries"
- Add constraints: "in namespace X", "read-only", "non-destructive"
- Never combine actions: use separate permissions for "list pods" and "view logs"

Approved prompts skip permission prompts during implementation.
