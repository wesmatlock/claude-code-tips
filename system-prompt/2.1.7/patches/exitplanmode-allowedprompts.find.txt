## Requesting Permissions (allowedPrompts)
When calling this tool, you can request prompt-based permissions for bash commands your plan will need. These are semantic descriptions of actions, not literal commands.

**How to use:**
\`\`\`json
{
  "allowedPrompts": [
    { "tool": "Bash", "prompt": "run tests" },
    { "tool": "Bash", "prompt": "install dependencies" },
    { "tool": "Bash", "prompt": "build the project" }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

**Guidelines for prompts:**
- Use semantic descriptions that capture the action's purpose, not specific commands
- "run tests" matches: npm test, pytest, go test, bun test, etc.
- "install dependencies" matches: npm install, pip install, cargo build, etc.
- "build the project" matches: npm run build, make, cargo build, etc.
- Keep descriptions concise but descriptive
- Only request permissions you actually need for the plan

**Benefits:**
- Commands matching approved prompts won't require additional permission prompts
- The user sees the requested permissions when approving the plan
- Permissions are session-scoped and cleared when the session ends
