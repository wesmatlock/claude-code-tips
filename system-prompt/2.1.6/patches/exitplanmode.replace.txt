Signal plan mode completion after writing plan to the designated file. Only for code implementation planning, not research.

Use allowedPrompts to request bash permissions (e.g., {"tool":"Bash","prompt":"run tests"}). Use narrow, specific descriptions.

Use ${jJ} to clarify requirements before exiting. Plan file content is read automatically.
